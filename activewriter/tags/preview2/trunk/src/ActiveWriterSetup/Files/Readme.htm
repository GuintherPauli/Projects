        ActiveWriter Preview 2</strong><br />
        <br />
        ActiveWriter is a visual designer, an addin for Visual Studio 2005, to design a domain
        model and to generate code decorated with <a href="http://www.castleproject.org/index.php/ActiveRecord"
            target="_blank">ActiveRecord</a> attributes.<br />
        <br />
        If you are familiar with ActiveRecord, this tool will make your ActiveRecord experience
        a little easier. If you are not, be sure to check ActiveRecord's web site given
        above first, there are tons of information to begin with and a great forum if you
        need some help.<br />

        <strong>Preview 2 Release - 18/03/2007<br />
            <br />
        </strong>What's new:<br />
        <ul>
            <li>Built with VS SDK v4.</li>
            <li>Generics support (ActiveRecordBase<t></t>
                &amp; ActiveRecordValidationBase<t></t>) (Generics is the default in the designer)
            </li>
            <li>VB.NET seems OK (Not tested extensively). </li>
            <li>Auto-sensing project type (C# or VB.NET) for code generation. You don't have to
                set that in the model anymore. </li>
            <li>New ActiveWriter Class Details toolwindow. Can be used for rapidly adding class
                properties. (Idea: Ayende) </li>
            <li>AR validators are supported for each property (not for field, key, composite key,
                timestamp or version) through a designer. </li>
            <li>Ability to customize the base class. You can substitude your own base class from
                the editor or generate classes without a base class. </li>
            <li>Ability to customize the source property name for associations. This is necessary
                for hierarchical objects, where they point to themselves, and using the class name
                resulted in un-compilable code in previous build. (Reported By: Ayende) </li>
            <li>More domain consistency check through validations when opening / saving. </li>
            <li>Applying pluralizing rules to the table name from the entity name if not specified.
                (Idea: Ayende) </li>
            <li>Ability to select a property for optional DebuggerDisplay attribute. </li>
            <li>Ability to decorate classes with GeneratedCodeAttribute. </li>
            <li>No more setting Custom Tool property of an .actiw file to ActiveWriterCodeGenerator
                manually after creating the file. It's done automatically. (Thanks: Bogdan Pietroiu)
            </li>
            <li>Key icon decorator on class shapes if a primary or composite key property exists
                (pure cosmetic). </li>
            <li>Key icon decorator on class shapes if at least a property has validator(s) set (pure
                cosmetic). </li>
            <li>Connector shapes changed to a more-UML-like notation. </li>
            <li>Extended nullable support. You may choose between nullables through external Nullables
                library (1.1 style) or native nullables usage of 2.0 framework. </li>
            <li>Some added properties to support changes (not all) in Castle trunk for ActiveRecordAttribute,
                PropertyAttribute etc. </li>
        </ul>
        What's crippled:<br />
        <ul>
            <li>- Using Output window less when doing drag-drop from Server Explorer to prevent
                a bug.</li>
        </ul>
