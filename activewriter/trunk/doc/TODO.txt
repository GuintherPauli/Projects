- Extract Nested menu command, which extracts some of the properties into a nested class or select one of the existing nested classes.
- When adding a new property, handle enter key properly in toolwindow.
- Double derived?
- Import?
- Sync. attribute properties with AR trunk.
- Shouldn't it also be good practice when setting the Key Type to Primary key it is always NotNUll=true? (Robert van Hoornaar )
- Display watermark links on the design surface in an empty designer.
- Display informative messages and progress in status bar during server explorer interactions.
- Implement ValidateNotSameAttribute support.
- Would be nice if one could make the labels in the relations visible, that is the source and target property names...  (Gabriel)

Ayende:
- Classes should probably have a default Id property. (?)
- While you can specify discriminators, there doesn’t seem to be a way to use inheritance. (Implementing Type hierarchies)
- On the Northwind database, dragging the Customers table generate a PK of type System.Char
- Another option to consider is to use the inflector to singularize the table tables when dragging from server explorer.

1. A UseIdentifierQuoting or similarly named inheritable model property that would allow one to avoid the need to manually specify table and column names to include the `` quoting characters.
2. Class inheritance mapping using a connector instead of manually filling out all necessary properties.
3. Importing classes from other diagrams to allow grouping classes by functionality (preferably also from referenced assemblies).
4. Generation of static methods for use with the ObjectDataSource class in ASP.NET. I noticed a comment in the code saying that support for MonoRail will be added through plugins. Is the necessary framework anywhere near completion?
