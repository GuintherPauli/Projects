After you checkout this solution (or after an update) you should run GenerateAssemblyInfo.bat in order to get the needed AssemblyInfo.cs files generated in the main projects (Castle.MonoRail.Views.AspView and VCompile)

After that you can use Visual Studio (or any other IDE) to work on the source code.
