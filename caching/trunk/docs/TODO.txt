1. The Memcached wrapper contains an awful reflection-based hack to
   support Dispose() and obtaining the name of an already created pool.
   Should file a bug for this.

2. There seems to be a delay before the first sockets in the pool become usable.
   This can cause the tests to fail if a suitable delay is not inserted.

3. Support cache dependencies.

4. Enhance MemcachedCache to avoid redundant concurrent population of cache entries
   when possible.  This is tricky.  Might be easier to confine the optimization
   to the scope of a single process to avoid cross-process synchronization issues.

5. Support advisory locking of cache entries.  (Maybe)

6. Support statistics gathering, instrumentation and adaptive tuning features.  (Maybe)

7. Decide based on use feedback whether to rename "GetOrPopulate" to something more
   palatable like "LazyGet".
