	<para>
		It is easy to send emails using MonoRail combining templates as
		you do with the views. Layouts are not applied to e-mail
		template, though.

			A sample demonstrating the concepts in the section can be
			downloaded from
			!download/monorail/trunk/MonoRail.SendingEmailSample.zip
		</para>

	<para>
		First you have to configure the smtp host address. See TODO
		[[MonoRail Configuration Reference#Formal_reference|Formal
		reference topic]]
	</para>
	<para>
		The most manual way to send an email is to configure a
		<literal>Castle.Components.Common.EmailSender.Message</literal>
		instance and invoke
		<literal>DeliverEmail</literal>
		which is exposed by the
		<literal>Controller</literal>
		class.
	</para>
	<para>
		A better way is to externalize the configuration of the
		<literal>Message</literal>
		. You can do that by creating view templates on the
		<literal>mail</literal>
		folder under your views directory. You can even add headers like
		from, to and subject to the template. They will be used to
		properly set up the
		<literal>Message</literal>
		instance. The rest of the view template will be considered the
		e-mail body. If the body starts with an
		<literal>&lt;html&gt;</literal>
		tag, the
		<literal>Message</literal>
		format will be changed to Html.
	</para>
	<para>
		The method
		<literal>RenderMailMessage</literal>
		can be used to create a configured
		<literal>Message</literal>
		instance based on the specified template. It gives you a chance
		to modify the message before sending it with
		<literal>DeliverEmail</literal>
		.
	</para>
	<para>
		The method
		<literal>RenderEmailAndSend</literal>
		is a combination of the methods above. It creates the
		<literal>Message</literal>
		instance and sends it.
