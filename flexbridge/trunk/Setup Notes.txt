Setup Notes
===========

Soon there will be build scripts.
In the meantime you must do the following things to get the code
to build and run:

1. Install Adobe Flex Builder 2.
2. Install MbUnit v2.4.190.
3. Import the Castle.FlexBridge.Tests.WebResources project into Flex Builder
   and build it.  It should generate FlexHarness.swf and a few HTML files.
4. Register Libs\Cassini\bin\Cassini.dll in the GAC.
5. Open up the Castle.FlexBridge solution in Visual Studio and build it.
6. Run the Castle.FlexBridge.Tests project using TestDriven.Net.
